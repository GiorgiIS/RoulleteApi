## Prerequisites

- .Net core 3.1 and MSSQL SERVER should be installed. 
- You may need to change connection string, just target the server where you have permission to create database

## Installation
- Clone github repository, or download and unzip it. 
- Make startup project RoulleteApi.
- Here is the connection string: Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=RoulleteDb; integrated security=true
  Make sure you have MSSQL Server with access of creating database. If localhost don't work for you configure it as you wish.
- run "update-database" command in package manager console, if you use visual studio. 
  Don't forget startup project should be RoulleteApi, but db context is in RoulleteApi.Repository.Ef project.

<b>Note</b>: There is just one user in database, and regisration functionality is not added for now. <b>Username:</b> gisaiashvili, 		  <b>Password</b>: 123456!Aa

## Testing

You can check testing instructions in <b>RoulleteApi/Additional Resources/Video Instructions</b>

You can test it by swagger doc or postman.
If you decide to test with postman you don't need to configure it yourself, just import json from Additional Resoures/Postman Test Collection folder.

Basic flow to test:

First of all you need to login and get access token.
Getting access token is possible from <b>user/session</b> post endpoint, by passing <b>Username</b>: gisaiashvili, <b>Password</b>:123456!Aa

Tokens format is 'Bearer accessToken'. e.x. 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiI...'
If you are testing it from swagger click Authorize and paste token there, or add this token in Authorization header. Again, don't forget to add 'Bearer ' before token

<b>Note:</b> The tokens life lasts for five minutes, 
	     If authorized client makes a new api call, new token will be returned in response header X-Response-Access-Token.
